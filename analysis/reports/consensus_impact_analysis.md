# Consensus Flag Impact on Model Performance

Does requiring the combo models to all agree improve ROI?

Edge measured against **opening lines** (what you'd actually bet at).
Consensus = combo models individually agree on direction vs opening line.

- **Spreads**: KP+BT combo → consensus = KP and BT both agree on direction
- **Totals**: KP+BT+HA combo → consensus = KP, BT, and HA all agree on direction
