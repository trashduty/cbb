## Comparison to KP+BT Model

To compare with the KP+BT model analysis, refer to `moneyline_analysis.md`.

**Key Differences:**
- This analysis uses the **median** of EM and BT win probabilities
- KP+BT analysis uses the **average** of KP and BT win probabilities
- Sample sizes and date ranges may differ

---

## Methodology

- **Predicted Win Probability**: Median of Evanmiya and Barttorvik win probabilities
- **Market Win Probability**: Derived from opening moneyline odds
- **Edge**: pred_win_prob - market_win_prob
- **ROI Calculation**:
  - For favorites (negative odds): Risk = |moneyline|, Win = $100
  - For underdogs (positive odds): Risk = $100, Win = moneyline
  - ROI = Total Profit / Total Risk × 100%
- **Probability Bands**: 10% buckets from 0-10% to 91-100%
- **Data Source**: graded_results.csv (filtered to one row per game)
