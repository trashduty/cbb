# Moneyline Edge Analysis by Win Probability Range

**Model Combination: KP+BT (KenPom + Barttorvik)**

## Key Question
When we have a 2%+ moneyline edge, should we bet everything or only certain win probability ranges?

## TL;DR

| Edge Threshold | All Bets (ROI) | Filtered 10-40% or 60-90% (ROI) |
|----------------|----------------|----------------------------------|
| 2%+ | +17.8% (85 games) | +57.3% (54 games) |
| 3%+ | +33.2% (63 games) | +85.6% (40 games) |
| 4%+ | +23.9% (43 games) | +83.1% (25 games) |

## Why Heavy Dogs (0-25%) Show High ROI

- **19 games at 2%+ edge**: 5 wins, 14 losses (26.3% win rate)
- **Win rate matches expectation** (17.7%) - model is well-calibrated
- **But the payouts are massive** when they hit:

| Date | Team | Model Prob | Market Prob | Edge | Odds | Payout |
|------|------|-----------|-------------|------|------|--------|
| 2025-12-28 | N Colorado Bears | 14.0% | 10.2% | 3.8% | +880 | +8.80 |
| 2025-11-27 | TCU Horned Frogs | 17.5% | 12.5% | 5.0% | +700 | +7.00 |
| 2026-01-03 | Mississippi St Bulldogs | 22.0% | 17.2% | 4.8% | +480 | +4.80 |
| 2025-11-24 | Seton Hall Pirates | 22.5% | 18.2% | 4.3% | +450 | +4.50 |
| 2026-01-29 | Omaha Mavericks | 25.0% | 21.4% | 3.6% | +368 | +3.68 |

**5 wins totaling +28.8 units offset 14 losses of -1 unit each = +14.8 units on 19 bets**

**The problem: remove just 2 of those 5 wins and ROI drops dramatically.** With a ~18% hit rate, long losing streaks are expected.

## Consistently Bad: 40-50% Slight Dogs

At every edge threshold, the 40-50% win probability range loses badly:
- 2%+ edge: -62.7% ROI (14 games)
- 3%+ edge: -59.8% ROI (13 games)
- 4%+ edge: -47.8% ROI (10 games)

## Also Bad: 50-60% Slight Favs

Despite being slight favorites, this range also loses at every threshold:
- 2%+ edge: -28.9% ROI (14 games)
- 3%+ edge: -55.6% ROI (10 games)
- 4%+ edge: -71.2% ROI (8 games)

## Also Bad: 25-40% Moderate Underdogs

- 2%+ edge: +36.5% ROI (13 games)
- 3%+ edge: +81.2% ROI (8 games)
- 4%+ edge: -11.3% ROI (4 games)

## Recommended Guardrails

**For moneyline betting with KP+BT edge:**

1. **Minimum 2% edge** to consider any bet
2. **AVOID 25-60% win probability range** - consistently loses regardless of edge size
3. **Moderate favorites (60-75%)** are the safest positive-ROI bucket
4. **Heavy underdogs (10-25%)** are positive EV but extremely high variance - only bet with proper bankroll management (small unit sizes)
5. **Heavy favorites (75%+)** - not enough data, and payouts are small

**Conservative approach**: Bet 3%+ edges in the 60-75% range only

**Aggressive approach**: Bet 2%+ edges in 10-25% OR 60-90% ranges, with smaller units on dogs

## Caveats

- Sample sizes are small at higher edge thresholds
- One season of data - patterns may not persist
- Heavy dog ROI is driven by a handful of big wins
- Results should be tracked prospectively to validate
