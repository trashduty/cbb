## Methodology

- **Opening Edge**: The difference between our model's predicted probability and the market's implied probability when the game first appeared in our system
- **Consensus**: All individual models agree on the direction of the bet
- **Profit Calculation**: Assumes flat betting at -110 standard juice (+0.909 units per win, -1 unit per loss)
- **Edge Tiers**: Games are bucketed by their opening edge percentage
- **Individual Model Performance**: Each model's performance across all games, regardless of edge

## Notes

- This report updates automatically every 15 minutes
- Only completed games with valid opening edges are included
- Games without opening edge data (e.g., missing from initial scrape) are excluded from this report
